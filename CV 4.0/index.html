              During my time at &#39;De Meander&#39; I set up a learning
              environment in year 2 that is focused on educating through play
              and movement. Whilst working in this position I developed numerous
              different methods for educating children including creating games,
              special projects and new working methods. I have also been
              influential in sharing and coordinating the use of these methods
              across different grades.

              During my time teaching at &#39;Annie M.G. Schmidtschool&#39; I
              worked using a modern e-learning system called &#39;snappet&#39;
              which has enabled me to provide first class and individualistic
              support for all my students. Teaching with such tooling allowed me
              to have a keen insight into the progress of my class and meet
              their specific needs for every lesson goal. Over the last two
              years I have been part of multiple lockdowns and online
              home-schooling. This was a challenging time, but through my
              go-getter attitude and thorough planning I made sure that the
              students in my class still achieved all their basic subjects to a
              high level. My secondary role at our school was that as the maths
              coordinator. I gave presentations and workshops to the team
              stimulating constant development and evaluation of the math
              education at our school.

              During my time as a teacher in year 6, (11-12 year olds), I helped
              prepare the kids for secondary education by encouraging and
              stimulating independence. Because of this they were able to learn
              how to plan and execute tasks in a safe environment before moving
              on with their studies.As a teacher in reception, I welcomed
              children to the school and guided them at the start of their
              primary school education. I provided a safe and structured
              learning environment, which made the students feel welcome and
              safe in my class and made them excited to go to school.<br />
              I was also the school&#39;s behaviour coordinator. In this role I
              ensured that the social emotional method is used correctly and
              actively within the entire school. I also stimulated the teams
              critical thinking towards the behaviour of children, parents and
              themselves by organising guest lectures and leading meetings.
